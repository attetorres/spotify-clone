> ⚠️ This repository is not an exact copy of the tutorial. I made several adaptations, fixes and improvements to:
>- Solve compatibility issues with current library versions.
>- Add features not included in the tutorial (such as smart mute/unmute volume control).
>- Deepen understanding of reactivity, state management and Vue best practices.
>This is a personal learning project.
